Server2Go
------------------------------
Server2Go is a CD-ROm Webserver. That means it is a webserver that can run
directly from cdrom without installation. Server2Go allows you to create a
working web site or PHP application on a CD-ROM. Using a web browser, a user can
run php programs as well as view html files on the CD-ROM. He only need to
insert a CD with Server2Go under the supported Windows operations systems. The
server starts automaticly and opens a browser with the Website of the CD-ROM

Server2Go supports PHP5, SQLite and MySQL.

problems starting the server you can start it directly under

you don't have to pay any royalty charges when distribute an application on
