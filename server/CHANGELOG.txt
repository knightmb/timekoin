determine network update status.
-- Peer Election now more intelligent by only submitting request when within 10
minutes of a peer election instead of constantly to save peer traffic and
processing time.
-- Further script optimizations to speed up processing for slower peers.
-- New indexes and database tweaks to further speed up processing of
transactions and status data for the user.

Timekoin Server - 2.01 (Released 2013-02-03)
============================================
- 0000050: [General Issue] Blank peers show up in Reserve Peer List
[1 issue]


Timekoin Server - 2.0 (Released 2013-02-02)
============================================
- Updated Web interface to be more compact and offer more room for Timekoin
controls and information for the user.

- Added new script file "balance.php". The purpose of the script is to run
regular balance indexes on random, recent public keys to help speed up
transaction processing by the treasurer script.

- Added the ability to generate new key pairs (Private/Public) in the 'options'
section of the Web interface for Timekoin. Thus, the manual way of using
"keys.php" is no longer necessary.

- Added new feature "Check for Updates" in the 'options' section of the Web
interface for Timekoin. This will allow the user to update the software scripts
to the latest release version directly from the Timekoin website if desired.

- Added new feature to check both Peer Clock Times and Ping Times in the
'system' section of the Web interface for Timekoin.

- Added new feature for Timekoin to do random audits of the Transaction History
through the Transaction Foundations. The feature can be tweaked in the 'system'
section of the Web interface for Timekoin. This can help spot damaged areas of
the database that Timekoin is using.

- Added new Peer metrics in the 'Peerlist' section. Peer Speed is combined peer
performance measured over a 10 second interval. Ten is the average baseline.
Group Response is a sample average of all peers and how long it took the group
to respond to a 10 second task. Less than 10 seconds increases peer speed by +1
and longer than 10 seconds decreases peer speed by -1.

- Peer Processor is now more aggressive at connecting to other peers and
removing offline/zombie peers from the peer list as well as fixing unique
situations where the same peer would show up more than once in the list.

- Transaction Clerk now uses the Peer Metric (Peer Speed) to fine tune
on-the-fly transaction data exchanges. The higher the number, the more data that
other peers are able to deliver when updating the transaction history.

- Timekoin Web interface now logs invalid login attempts made by IP address,
username and password attempted in the event logs (GUI filter).

- Event logs in the 'tools' section of Web interface now have proper event
filters for all events. Some events before were left out of the filter list
and very difficult to find.

- Generation Peer Request and Generation Transactions are restricted to one per
IP address, otherwise the peer will ban other offending peers for 24 hours.
