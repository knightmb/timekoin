Timekoin Server - Change Log

Timekoin Server - 4.16 (Released 2021-8-26)
============================================
- Complete code audit to increase system performance and check code security against exploits
- Tied user settings to Transaction Cycle checks, just like Foundation checks are now for how frequent to check their database against the network
- More tweaks to allow the system to shutdown faster during heavy peer traffic without waiting so long to finish
- Generation Manager won't create peer payment transactions for upcoming election if it detects a firewall issue to avoid losing funds when inbound connections are not working properly
- Added separate ipv4 firewall testing poll since some servers are using the ipv6 address instead of the ipv4 when doing a DNS lookup on timekoin.net
- Raised all polling maximums to handle more transactions per cycle (roughly +19,000)
- RSA key max cap raised to 20,480 from 17,408 bits
- API updated to handle larger key sizes and more API traffic
- Update RSA code for 8% increase in speed, getting ready for future use of OAEP RSA encryption and sunset PKCS1 currently used

Timekoin Server - 4.15 (Released 2021-8-17)
============================================
- Created new function to handle Easy Key creation that has better logic for checking against future peer elections and scheduling transactions to avoid interference with a fail-safe user warning just in case it is not possible
- Backup Tab can now export server keys to a file that can be used to restore the server keys to itself or another server. This can help eliminate human error or browser weirdness trying to manually copy and paste keys
- Generation Peer manager uses wrong peer list count for payment checking for the ipv6 network, resulting in a slightly lower fee requirement

Timekoin Server - 4.14 (Released 2021-8-15)
============================================
- Trying to create an Easy Key during an election will fail with a warning until the election is over
- Fixed Permanent Peer Priority setting causing outbound polling issues when no Permanent Peer is assigned to the Peerlist
- Enabled "Database Update" button in the Options Tab for TK server to upgrade the database to larger index sizes within Timekoin
- Added RAM cache logic to Treasurer process when processing a large batch of transactions for the same public key that polls the database less and speeds up balance checking
- Updated default sql template for TK server to include new index sizes for transaction history table
- Updated logic for new servers with a blank transaction history to start building quicker
- Fixed activation issue related new servers and a blank transaction history database if you stop it before it does the testing phase
- Fix for generating peer that changes IP and sends a network request to update the new change but was also paying all the generating servers as thought it was an election when not required
- Fix timing issue for Easy Key on Windows servers that prevents the final creation of the shortcut after making payment for the shortcut
- Updated Generation Peer Manager with better logic for consulting peers when comparing generation list of public keys
- Fixed a rare (and long known, but could not previously replicate) bug during a super peer connection that can cause the transaction clerk to shutdown its database connection requiring a restart to restore
- Fixed servers not able to find gateway peers when polling from ipv4 to ipv6 networks or vice-versa
- Added duplicate clearing check to the transaction queue during heavy data exchanges with large numbers of active peers (+50 usually)
- Better flood protection logic to prevent normal peers from getting banned from your server by accident
- Memory safe all functions for PHP +v7.x and higher to fit new PHP security model
- Added button to generate offline key pairs in the "Options" tab for offline storage of separate keys & balance
- Added copy to clipboard buttons for Timekoin server "backup" tab to help with browser issues that don't select all the key data when manually trying to copy keys for backup purposes
- Domains with ipv6 address were failing look-ups because the original function only output ipv4 address, new function created to address this issue.

requires reverse Domain/IP verification of any peer that wants to be elected for
currency generation. This is to help stop electing keys from a single server
pretending to be many servers.

determine network update status.
-- Peer Election now more intelligent by only submitting request when within 10
minutes of a peer election instead of constantly to save peer traffic and
processing time.
-- Further script optimizations to speed up processing for slower peers.
-- New indexes and database tweaks to further speed up processing of
transactions and status data for the user.

-- Updating code refreshed to now update graphics and css style sheets.
-- Better Peer handling for offline or malfunctioning peers.


Timekoin Server - 2.01 (Released 2013-02-03)
============================================
- 0000050: [General Issue] Blank peers show up in Reserve Peer List
[1 issue]


Timekoin Server - 2.0 (Released 2013-02-02)
============================================
- Updated Web interface to be more compact and offer more room for Timekoin
controls and information for the user.

- Added new script file "balance.php". The purpose of the script is to run
regular balance indexes on random, recent public keys to help speed up
transaction processing by the treasurer script.

- Added the ability to generate new key pairs (Private/Public) in the 'options'
section of the Web interface for Timekoin. Thus, the manual way of using
"keys.php" is no longer necessary.

- Added new feature "Check for Updates" in the 'options' section of the Web
interface for Timekoin. This will allow the user to update the software scripts
to the latest release version directly from the Timekoin website if desired.

- Added new feature to check both Peer Clock Times and Ping Times in the
'system' section of the Web interface for Timekoin.

- Added new feature for Timekoin to do random audits of the Transaction History
through the Transaction Foundations. The feature can be tweaked in the 'system'
section of the Web interface for Timekoin. This can help spot damaged areas of
the database that Timekoin is using.

- Added new Peer metrics in the 'Peerlist' section. Peer Speed is combined peer
performance measured over a 10 second interval. Ten is the average baseline.
Group Response is a sample average of all peers and how long it took the group
to respond to a 10 second task. Less than 10 seconds increases peer speed by +1
and longer than 10 seconds decreases peer speed by -1.

- Peer Processor is now more aggressive at connecting to other peers and
removing offline/zombie peers from the peer list as well as fixing unique
situations where the same peer would show up more than once in the list.

- Transaction Clerk now uses the Peer Metric (Peer Speed) to fine tune
on-the-fly transaction data exchanges. The higher the number, the more data that
other peers are able to deliver when updating the transaction history.

- Timekoin Web interface now logs invalid login attempts made by IP address,
username and password attempted in the event logs (GUI filter).

- Event logs in the 'tools' section of Web interface now have proper event
filters for all events. Some events before were left out of the filter list
and very difficult to find.

- Generation Peer Request and Generation Transactions are restricted to one per
IP address, otherwise the peer will ban other offending peers for 24 hours.
